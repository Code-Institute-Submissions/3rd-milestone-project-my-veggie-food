## Validating HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python code.

## Compatibility with different browsers

In order to ensure that the website would work properly in the following browsers, responsiveness tests, button and link checks were done, as well as tests on the look of the website to ensure that the colors, images and fonts used would display correctly.

- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Apple Safari

## Responsiveness in different screen sizes

I have made the following response tests in order to ensure that the website operates correctly and at the same time that its components are seen harmoniously arranged in different screen sizes, so that I used the following tools to help me.

- **Responsinator**: This website was used to simulate different screen sizes of mobile devices. This was really useful, because it showed in real time the aspect of the tested website, helping to discover different responsiveness problems.

Here as you can see, there are some screenshots of how the website looks in different screen sizes.

- **Mozilla Firefox**: This browser was used to check the behavior of the web page in different screen sizes using the Developer Tools. Tests consisted in testing the appearance of the fonts used, the aspect of colors and backgrounds, the order and space used by the different elements that make up the web page.

- **Google Chrome**: This browser was used to check the behavior of the web page in different screen sizes using the Developer Tools. As in the previous browser, different tests were performed checking the aspect of the font used, colors and backgrounds, and finally, the space used by the elements of the website. In addition, a contrast was made between both browsers, checking for any existing differences.

- **Xiaomi Mi A1**: This mobile device was used to test the behavior of the website, using browsers such as Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and DuckDuckGo.

- **Xiaomi Poco x3**: This mobile device was used to test the behavior of the website, using browsers such as Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and DuckDuckGo.
