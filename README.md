# My Veggie Food
## Code Institute: Milestone Project 3

My Veggie Food is a website where users can read and upload their own recipes,
adding their vegetarian touch. Lately, more and more people are deciding to
change their eating habits, either for health reasons, or out of respect for animals.

This website aims to be a platform for people who want to start this new lifestyle,
showing delicious, easy and nutritious recipes, and best of all, with contribution from
the community.

easy way, and that it has a great variety of recipes.

me to upload my own recipes in an easy way and also to edit or delete my

laptop, to a mobile phone, because this way I can review the recipes while
I'm cooking.

categories, allowing me to make a quick and efficient search.
- As a user, I want a website that displays information in an organized way
